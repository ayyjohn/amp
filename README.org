Amp (asynchronous music player) is a command-line interface to YouTube that lets you play music with minimal disturbance to your workflow.  It takes arguments in the form of YouTube search terms and plays the first result in a background process.

* Installation
** Requirements
- Python 3.3 or newer
- A up-to-date version of [[https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv][mpv]]
- An up-to-date version of pip, setuptools, etc.

Once you have all of these, amp can be installed from pip (with root privileges).
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# pip install amp-player
#+END_EXAMPLE

Building amp from source is easy too:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ git clone https://github.com/nivekuil/amp.git
$ cd amp
# python setup.py install
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Planned features/fixes
- List multiple results to choose a song from
- Filter by duration
- Queue songs
- Song history
- Handle invalid options more gracefully
- When external dependency fails, show error output

* Troubleshooting
If playback ends abnormally before anything starts playing, it might be an issue with one of amp's dependencies.  Try using ==amp --verbose== to get the URL of the video, and then play the URL with mpv directly.  If that works, then please submit an issue (or pull request!).
